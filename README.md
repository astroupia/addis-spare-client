# Addis Spare Part Platform

## Preface

The Addis Spare Part platform was conceived in response to the growing need for a centralized, efficient, and reliable solution in the automotive spare parts industry in Ethiopia. Traditionally, finding the right spare part for a specific vehicle has been a time-consuming and uncertain process. This project aims to change that by creating a digital marketplace that prioritizes accuracy, trust, and convenience for both buyers and sellers. This document reflects input from team members with expertise in system design, user experience, engineering, and business strategy. It is the result of collaborative planning and serves as the starting point for building a platform that can scale and adapt as user needs evolve.

## Introduction

The Addis Spare Parts E-Commerce Platform is a web-based marketplace designed to revolutionize the automotive spare parts industry by connecting buyers (car owners, mechanics) with sellers (suppliers, retailers) in a seamless, secure, and scalable digital ecosystem. This PRD outlines the product vision, objectives, and requirements to guide development, design, and stakeholder alignment.

## Technology Stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
